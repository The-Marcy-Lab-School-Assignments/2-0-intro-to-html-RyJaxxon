# Question

What's the difference between "semantic" and "non-semantic" elements?

# Answer

Semantic elements are one's that often tell the developer what they do in their names. For example, \<h> would be for headers, and \<p> for paragraphs. This is decently noticable through their tag names 'h' and 'p'.

Non-Semantic elements are those that aren't so clear cut from the outside. Elements like \<div> and \<span> don't necessarily tell the developer what type of content these tags would entail from their name alone, making them non-semantic.They're often used for layout and structuring purposes.

# Teacher Feedback

Great response, the only thing I do want to point out is that the tag for `header` is not `h`, but rather `header`.
